# Claude-Assisted Rule-Safe Hackathon Setup Guide — Benefits Navigator for Families

A rule-safe, end-to-end guide for building the **Benefits Navigator** app for the
**Databricks Apps & Agents Hackathon for Good 2026**. Claude can help you at every
step (code, SQL, commands, troubleshooting) **only if AI assistance is permitted**.

> **No real secrets in this document.** Everything sensitive is a `<PLACEHOLDER>`.

>
> **This guide is not legal advice.** It reflects the *safest interpretation* of
> the official rules. When uncertain, **confirm with the organizers.**

---

## 0. Official Rules Alignment — Read First

These points come straight from the official hackathon rules and govern
everything below:

- **New projects only — built during the Project Period.** The project must be
  **created only during the Project Period**: **Mon, June 15, 2026 8:00 AM PT →
  Tue, June 16, 2026 2:30 PM PT**. (Judging Period: Tue, June 16, 2026 2:30 PM PT
  → 6:00 PM PT.)
- **Your public GitHub repo must show the project was built during the Project
  Period.** Commit your meaningful work **in-window**.
- **Do not submit your old repo as-is.** Reusing/forking/copying a prior working
  repo for the final submission is **not** assumed to be allowed — see §3.
- **Required build:** a **Databricks App built on Lakebase** that uses **one or
  more additional Databricks tools** (e.g., Unity Catalog, Databricks SQL).
- **Use Claude (or any AI assistant) only if permitted.** If allowed, use it
  **during the Project Period** and keep all work **transparent**.
- **Use synthetic demo data only.** No real personal information.
- **No employer / proprietary / confidential code or data.** The submission must
  be the **team's original work**, owned by the team, not violating third-party
  IP. Open-source dependencies are fine if you follow their licenses.
- **No secrets in GitHub.** Keys/tokens/passwords live in Databricks
  secrets/app resources, never in the repo.
- **Open-source license required** in the public repo.
- **Demonstration video must be ≤ 3 minutes** and public.

When in doubt: **disclose and ask the organizers.** Transparency protects your
submission.

## 1. Overview

This guide takes you from "empty hackathon Databricks workspace + my public
GitHub repo" to a **fully deployed, demo-ready Benefits Navigator**:

1. Get the code into a hackathon-eligible GitHub repo.
2. Set up your laptop to run it locally.
3. Stand up the **trusted data** (Unity Catalog / Delta) and a **SQL Warehouse**.
4. Stand up **Lakebase Postgres** app-state tables.
5. Configure the **Databricks App** (resources, secrets, `app.yaml`).
6. Grant the App's **service principal** access to Lakebase.
7. Deploy, validate, and rehearse the demo.

Each phase includes **copy-paste Claude prompts** (§11) and a **troubleshooting
FAQ** (§14).

---

## 2. Target Final Architecture

| Layer | Component | Role |
|---|---|---|
| UX | **Databricks App + Streamlit UI** | Friendly intake form, program cards, feedback widget |
| Reasoning | **Claude agent** | Extract profile, ask adaptive questions, write action plan |
| Reasoning | **Rules engine** | Deterministic, explainable eligibility screening |
| Trusted data | **Unity Catalog / Delta** `benefits_navigator.trusted.benefit_programs` | Source-labeled NJ programs + rule columns |
| Trusted data | **Databricks SQL Warehouse** | Secure, governed read access via SQL connector |
| App state | **Lakebase Postgres** | `family_intake_events`, `program_matches`, `action_plans`, `user_feedback` |
| Impact | **Feedback + analytics** | County needs, program demand, feedback trends |

Repo files involved: `app.py`, `agent.py`, `benefits_rules.py`,
`databricks_client.py`, `lakebase_client.py`, `requirements.txt`, `app.yaml`,
`sample_data/programs.json` (local fallback), `social_impact_analytics.sql`.

---

## 3. GitHub Setup — Create a Brand-New Repo During the Project Period

> ⚠️ **The official rules require "New Projects Only."** Do **not** submit your
> existing repo as-is. The **recommended, rule-safe** path is to create a
> **brand-new public repo during the Project Period** and build in-window.

Use placeholders:
- `<NEW_PUBLIC_REPO_URL>` — the brand-new public repo you create during the event.

### ✅ Recommended — Create a brand-new repo during the Project Period

At/after **June 15, 2026 8:00 AM PT**, create a new **public** repo and start
committing:

```bash
mkdir benefits-navigator-hackathon
cd benefits-navigator-hackathon
git init
echo "# Benefits Navigator Hackathon" > README.md
git add .
git commit -m "Initial hackathon repo created during project period"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin <NEW_PUBLIC_REPO_URL>
git push -u origin main
```

Then build the project files **during the Project Period** (use the Claude
prompts in §11 — each one builds from scratch, no prior-repo code). Add an
**open-source license** (e.g., MIT or Apache-2.0) as a `LICENSE` file.

> Your prior working repo (if any) may only be used as **private practice /
> reference before the event**, never copied wholesale into the submission.

### ⚠️ Only if organizers explicitly approve repo reuse

Do **not** fork/copy a previous repo unless the organizers **confirm in writing**
that it is allowed. If they do approve:

- Fork/copy the existing **public** repo, then **clearly disclose** in your README
  what existed **before** vs. what was built **during** the Project Period.
- Still make your final, meaningful hackathon work visible through **commits
  during the Project Period**.
- Still ensure the final submission is **original, owned by your team, and
  compliant** (open-source licenses respected, no proprietary/confidential code).

### 3a. Commit evidence (prove in-window work)

The repo must show the project was built **during** the Project Period:

- [ ] **Commit early and often** during the Project Period (don't dump one giant
      end-of-event commit).
- [ ] Use **meaningful commit messages** that track real progress.
- [ ] Keep the repo **public**.
- [ ] Add an **open-source license** (`LICENSE`).
- [ ] **Do not rewrite history** (no force-push/rebase that hides timestamps)
      after submission.

---

## 4. Local Laptop Setup (same laptop, PowerShell)

```powershell
# Into the brand-new hackathon repo you created during the Project Period
cd benefits-navigator-hackathon

# Create and activate a virtual environment (Windows PowerShell)
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a local `.env` (for local/dev only — **never commit it**):

```dotenv
# .env  (LOCAL ONLY — do NOT commit. Use placeholders; fill with your own values.)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<YOUR_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY>

# Databricks SQL connector (trusted-data read)
DATABRICKS_SERVER_HOSTNAME=<YOUR_WORKSPACE_HOST>      # e.g. <workspace-host-without-https>
DATABRICKS_HTTP_PATH=/sql/1.0/warehouses/<WAREHOUSE_ID>
DATABRICKS_TOKEN=<YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN>          # local/dev only

# Local Lakebase (manual mode) — optional for local testing
LAKEBASE_HOST=<YOUR_PG_HOST>
LAKEBASE_PORT=5432
LAKEBASE_DATABASE=databricks_postgres
LAKEBASE_USER=<YOUR_PG_USER>
LAKEBASE_PASSWORD=<YOUR_PG_PASSWORD>
```

Confirm `.env` is ignored:

```powershell
# .gitignore should contain a line: .env
Select-String -Path .gitignore -Pattern "^\.env$"
```

Run locally:

```powershell
streamlit run app.py
```

> The app **gracefully falls back** to `sample_data/programs.json` if Databricks
> isn't reachable, and still generates a plan if Lakebase writes fail — so you
> can develop locally even before the cloud pieces exist.

---

## 5. Databricks Workspace Setup

1. **Create or identify a SQL Warehouse**
   - In the new workspace: **SQL → SQL Warehouses → Create** (a small/serverless
     warehouse is fine for a demo). Start it.
2. **Capture the server hostname**
   - Warehouse → **Connection details** → **Server hostname**
     (e.g., `<workspace-host-without-https>`).
3. **Capture the HTTP path**
   - Same panel → **HTTP path** (e.g., `/sql/1.0/warehouses/<WAREHOUSE_ID>`).
4. **Create a token only if needed for local/dev**
   - **User Settings → Developer → Access tokens → Generate**. Use this only in
     your local `.env`. **Do not** commit it.
5. **In the deployed app, prefer Databricks App resources/secrets**
   - The deployed App should get the warehouse via an **app resource** and the
     Anthropic key via a **secret** — not a hard-coded token (§8).

---

## 6. Unity Catalog Trusted Data Setup

Run this in a Databricks **SQL editor** (or a notebook). It creates the trusted
catalog/schema/table with the **rule columns the current code reads** and loads
8 curated NJ programs.

```sql
-- Catalog + schema
CREATE CATALOG IF NOT EXISTS benefits_navigator;
CREATE SCHEMA  IF NOT EXISTS benefits_navigator.trusted;

-- Trusted, source-labeled benefit programs (+ rule columns used by the app)
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS benefits_navigator.trusted.benefit_programs (
    program_id              STRING,
    program_name            STRING,
    category                STRING,   -- food | healthcare | childcare | cash | family
    description             STRING,
    eligibility_summary     STRING,
    apply_url               STRING,
    apply_phone             STRING,
    source_name             STRING,
    source_url              STRING,
    source_type             STRING,
    state                   STRING,
    active_flag             BOOLEAN,
    last_verified_date      DATE,
    -- Rule columns consumed by benefits_rules.py via the adapter:
    rule_key                STRING,   -- maps to the engine's program id (snap, wic, ...)
    income_limit_pct_fpl    INT,
    accepts_undocumented    BOOLEAN,
    min_child_age           INT,
    max_child_age           INT,
    requires_work_or_school BOOLEAN
);

-- Refresh: clear and load the 8 curated programs (idempotent for demos)

```

---

## 7. Lakebase Setup

1. **Create a Lakebase project** in the workspace (e.g.,
   `benefits-navigator-lakebase`).
2. **Branch:** use **`production`**.
3. **Database:** **`databricks_postgres`**.
4. **Create the four app-state tables** (run in the Lakebase SQL editor /
   psql against `databricks_postgres`). These match what `lakebase_client.py`
   writes; `event_ts` defaults to `now()`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS family_intake_events (
    intake_id      TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    event_ts       TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    raw_user_text  TEXT,
    profile        JSONB
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS program_matches (
    match_id       TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    intake_id      TEXT REFERENCES family_intake_events(intake_id),
    event_ts       TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    program_id     TEXT,
    program_name   TEXT,
    category       TEXT,
    match_reasons  JSONB
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS action_plans (
    plan_id            TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    intake_id          TEXT REFERENCES family_intake_events(intake_id),
    event_ts           TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    action_plan_text   TEXT,
    generated_by_model TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS user_feedback (
    feedback_id    TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    intake_id      TEXT REFERENCES family_intake_events(intake_id),
    event_ts       TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    rating         INTEGER,
    feedback_text  TEXT
);
```

**Validation query (list tables):**

```sql
SELECT table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
ORDER BY table_name;
-- expect: action_plans, family_intake_events, program_matches, user_feedback
```

---

## 8. Databricks App Resources

In the Databricks App configuration, add:

- **SQL Warehouse resource** → exposes the warehouse to the app (used for the
  trusted-data read).
- **Anthropic API key secret** → a secret-scope entry surfaced as
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.
- **Databricks token secret** → only if your SQL connector path still needs a
  PAT (`DATABRICKS_TOKEN`). Prefer warehouse-resource auth where possible.
- **Lakebase database resource** → exposes the Lakebase endpoint and, on
  Autoscaling, injects the `PG*` connection env vars.

**`app.yaml` pattern** (non-secret values inline; secrets via `valueFrom`):

```yaml
command:
  - streamlit
  - run
  - app.py

env:
  - name: STREAMLIT_GATHER_USAGE_STATS
    value: "false"

  # Trusted-data read (SQL connector)
  - name: DATABRICKS_SERVER_HOSTNAME
    value: "<YOUR_WORKSPACE_HOST>"
  - name: DATABRICKS_HTTP_PATH
    value: "/sql/1.0/warehouses/<WAREHOUSE_ID>"

  # Secrets (never inline)
  - name: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
    valueFrom: anthropic-api-key
  - name: DATABRICKS_TOKEN          # only if the SQL connector still needs a PAT
    valueFrom: databricks-token

  # Lakebase (managed): resource + PG* injected by the database resource
  - name: LAKEBASE_RESOURCE
    valueFrom: lakebase-db          # e.g. projects/<p>/branches/production/endpoints/primary
  - name: LAKEBASE_DATABASE
    value: "databricks_postgres"
  - name: LAKEBASE_PORT
    value: "5432"
  # PGHOST / PGDATABASE / PGUSER / PGPORT / PGSSLMODE are expected to be injected
  # by the Lakebase database resource when available (Autoscaling). The app reads
  # them in managed mode and mints a short-lived OAuth token for the password.
```

> The current `lakebase_client.py` selects mode automatically: **manual** when
> `LAKEBASE_PASSWORD` is set (local), otherwise **managed** using `PG*` +
> `LAKEBASE_RESOURCE` and a minted OAuth credential.

---

## 9. Lakebase Service Principal Grants

**Why:** In a deployed Databricks App, writes happen as the **App's service
principal** (machine identity), **not** as your human user. So your human
ability to query Lakebase does **not** automatically let the App write — the
service-principal role needs explicit grants, or you'll see `permission denied`.

**Find the role** (run in Lakebase `databricks_postgres`):

```sql
SELECT rolname
FROM pg_roles
WHERE rolname ILIKE '%<APP_CLIENT_ID_PREFIX>%'
   OR rolname ILIKE '%benefits%'
   OR rolname ILIKE '%app%';
```

**Grant template** (replace `<APP_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_ROLE>` with the role you
found — often the App's client id / service-principal application id):

```sql
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO "<APP_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_ROLE>";

GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
ON TABLE family_intake_events,
         program_matches,
         action_plans,
         user_feedback
TO "<APP_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_ROLE>";

GRANT USAGE, SELECT
ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public
TO "<APP_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_ROLE>";
```

After granting, **redeploy/restart** the App and run one journey to confirm rows
land in the tables.

---

## 10. Deployment Steps

1. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Configure for hackathon Databricks workspace"
   git push origin main
   ```
2. **Create a Databricks App** in the new workspace (**Compute → Apps → Create**,
   or the Apps section).
3. **Connect the GitHub repo** (link `<NEW_PUBLIC_REPO_URL>`).
4. **Branch:** `main`.
5. **Source path:** leave **blank** unless the app lives in a subfolder (this
   repo's `app.py` is at the root).
6. **Add resources & secrets** (§8): SQL warehouse, Anthropic secret, optional
   Databricks token secret, Lakebase database resource.
7. **Deploy.**
8. **Check logs** — confirm: data-source selection, `psycopg.connect() succeeded`,
   and write-back commits (the app logs only safe status, never secrets).
9. **Open the app URL** and run a scenario (§13).

---

## 11. Claude Prompts for Each Phase

> ⚠️ **Rule-safe prompting (only if AI assistance is permitted).** Every prompt
> below is written to **build from scratch during the Project Period**. Each one
> instructs Claude to: **create from scratch during the hackathon**, **do not
> copy previous repo code**, **use placeholders for secrets**, and **use
> synthetic demo data**. Keep your usage transparent.

**Create the project skeleton (from scratch)**
```
Create a Streamlit + Databricks + Lakebase project skeleton from scratch during
the hackathon for an app called benefits-navigator-hackathon. Do not copy any
previous repo code. Create app.py, agent.py, benefits_rules.py,
databricks_client.py, lakebase_client.py, sample_data/programs.json,
requirements.txt, app.yaml, .gitignore, README.md, and a LICENSE. Use placeholders
for all secrets and use synthetic demo data only.
```

**Create requirements.txt (from scratch)**
```
Create requirements.txt from scratch for this app. Include streamlit, anthropic,
databricks-sql-connector, databricks-sdk>=0.89.0, psycopg[binary], and
python-dotenv. Do not copy from any previous repo. Use placeholders for secrets;
use synthetic demo data only.
```

**Create app.yaml (from scratch)**
```
Create app.yaml from scratch for Databricks Apps. Use the Streamlit run command.
Inline only non-secret values (DATABRICKS_SERVER_HOSTNAME, DATABRICKS_HTTP_PATH,
LAKEBASE_DATABASE, LAKEBASE_PORT). Use valueFrom for ANTHROPIC_API_KEY,
DATABRICKS_TOKEN, and the Lakebase resource. Do not put real secrets in the file
— placeholders only. Do not copy any previous repo. Use synthetic demo data only.
```

**Create databricks_client.py (from scratch)**
```
Create databricks_client.py from scratch during the hackathon. It should read
DATABRICKS_SERVER_HOSTNAME, DATABRICKS_HTTP_PATH, and DATABRICKS_TOKEN, query
benefits_navigator.trusted.benefit_programs, return a list of dicts, and fall
back to local JSON on failure. Log safe errors only (no secrets). Do not copy any
previous repo code. Use placeholders for secrets; use synthetic demo data only.
```

**Create lakebase_client.py (from scratch)**
```
Create lakebase_client.py from scratch during the hackathon. Support two modes:
(A) local/manual using LAKEBASE_HOST/PORT/DATABASE/USER/PASSWORD, and (B)
Databricks App managed mode using PG* env vars + the Lakebase resource +
Databricks SDK OAuth (w.postgres.generate_database_credential(endpoint=...)).
Expose write_intake_event, write_program_matches, write_action_plan,
write_feedback. Never log secrets; degrade gracefully. Do not copy any previous
repo code. Use placeholders for secrets; use synthetic demo data only.
```

**Add safe diagnostic logging**
```
Add INFO-level diagnostic logging to lakebase_client.py covering startup, mode
selection, managed credential generation, connection (sanitized params), and
each write (started/execute/commit/closed). Never log secrets, tokens,
passwords, full hosts, or raw user text. Log only present/missing status and
exception type/message.
```

**Troubleshoot SQL Warehouse connection**
```
My trusted-data read fails. Here is the exact error/log: <PASTE>. Help me
diagnose whether it's the hostname, HTTP path, token/permissions, a stopped
warehouse, or a missing table — and how to confirm the app fell back to local
JSON.
```

**Troubleshoot Lakebase connection**
```
Lakebase writes are failing. Here are the safe logs: <PASTE>. Tell me whether
this is mode selection, PG* vars, OAuth token generation, SSL, or permissions,
and the next concrete step.
```

**Troubleshoot service principal grants**
```
I get 'permission denied for table ...' when the deployed app writes to
Lakebase. Walk me through finding the App service-principal role in pg_roles and
the exact GRANT statements for the four app-state tables and sequences.
```

**Create impact analytics SQL**
```
Using my Lakebase schema (family_intake_events, program_matches, action_plans,
user_feedback with event_ts), write read-only analytics queries for: total
intakes, matches, plans, feedback; most common categories; most recommended
programs; average rating; and recent end-to-end journeys.
```

**Prepare demo scripts (3-min official video + 1-min pitch + 5-min backup)**
```
Write three demo scripts that frame this as agentic AI + governed trusted
Databricks data + Lakebase app state + social impact analytics, using the 'single
mom with two kids' scenario: (1) a <=3 minute OFFICIAL submission video script
(this is the version that counts), (2) a 60-second elevator pitch, and (3) a
5-minute backup for live Q&A/judging only if allowed. Keep the official one to
3 minutes maximum.
```

---

## 11a. Final Demo & Video (rule-aligned)

Per the official rules, the **demonstration video must be ≤ 3 minutes** and
public. Prepare three versions, but **the 3-minute video is the one that counts**:

- **60-second pitch** — quick elevator framing.
- **≤ 3-minute official video** — the submitted demo (record + upload publicly).
- **5-minute backup** — only for live Q&A / judging **if the organizers allow it**.

Suggested ≤3-minute structure:

| Time | Segment |
|---|---|
| 0:00–0:20 | Problem |
| 0:20–0:45 | Solution / architecture |
| 0:45–1:50 | Live app demo (scenario A) |
| 1:50–2:30 | Lakebase state + analytics |
| 2:30–3:00 | Impact closing |

---

## 13. Testing Scenarios (synthetic only)

> All inputs are **fictional/synthetic**. No real personal data.

### A. Single mom with two kids
- **Input:** "I'm a single mom with two kids ages 3 and 7. I work part-time and
  make about $1,800 a month. We don't have health insurance and I need childcare
  help."
- **Follow-up answers:** household size 3; working; needs childcare; documented.
- **Expected programs:** SNAP, NJ FamilyCare, CHIP, CCDF (child care), Preschool
  (age 3), possibly WIC if a child is under 5.
- **Proves:** end-to-end agentic flow with multiple grounded matches + reasons.

### B. Pregnant mother
- **Input:** "I'm pregnant with my first child and not working right now. Money
  is very tight."
- **Follow-up answers:** pregnant yes; household size 1-2; low income.
- **Expected programs:** WIC, NJ FamilyCare; possibly SNAP/TANF depending on
  income.
- **Proves:** pregnancy-aware rules and prenatal support matching.

### C. Higher-income family needing child coverage
- **Input:** "We make a decent income but can't afford private health insurance
  for our two school-age kids."
- **Follow-up answers:** income near upper threshold; children under 19.
- **Expected programs:** CHIP (higher FPL ceiling), maybe NJ FamilyCare.
- **Proves:** income thresholds work — not everyone matches everything.

### D. Utility bill emergency
- **Input:** "I'm behind on my heating bill and worried about a shutoff this
  winter."
- **Follow-up answers:** low/moderate income; household with dependents.
- **Expected programs:** LIHEAP (energy assistance); possibly SNAP.
- **Proves:** needs-based matching beyond just income.

### E. Childcare-focused working parent
- **Input:** "I just started a full-time job and need affordable daycare for my
  4-year-old."
- **Follow-up answers:** working full-time; child age 4; needs childcare.
- **Expected programs:** CCDF (requires work/school), Preschool (age 3-4).
- **Proves:** `requires_work_or_school` and child-age rule columns in action.

### F. Immigration-sensitive family
- **Input:** "We need food and prenatal help, but we're worried about
  immigration status."
- **Follow-up answers:** undocumented; pregnant or child under 5.
- **Expected programs:** WIC and Preschool (which accept undocumented in our
  data); restricted programs correctly excluded.
- **Proves:** `accepts_undocumented` handling — inclusive and accurate.

### G. State retention demo
- **Input:** Run scenario A, submit feedback, then **redeploy** the app.
- **Check:** previously written rows still in Lakebase; new journey appends.
- **Proves:** Lakebase persistence + the social-impact data is durable.

## 14. FAQ and Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| **SQL warehouse `ENDPOINT_NOT_FOUND` / not found** | Wrong `DATABRICKS_HTTP_PATH` or stopped warehouse | Recopy HTTP path from warehouse connection details; start the warehouse |
| **Missing `DATABRICKS_TOKEN`** | Secret not set / not referenced | Add the token secret and `valueFrom: databricks-token` in `app.yaml` (only if the connector needs a PAT) |
| **`Table or view not found`** | Trusted table not created in this workspace | Re-run §6 catalog/schema/table + insert |
| **App uses fallback JSON instead of Databricks** | Connector failed and fell back silently | Check logs for the read error; verify host/path/token/warehouse + table; caption will read "local fallback" |
| **Anthropic key missing** | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` not set | Add the secret and `valueFrom: anthropic-api-key`; verify the agent step |
| **Lakebase env vars missing** | Neither manual nor managed config present | Set `LAKEBASE_PASSWORD` (local) **or** attach the Lakebase resource so `PG*` + `LAKEBASE_RESOURCE` are injected |
| **PAT/OAuth conflict** (`more than one authorization method configured: oauth and pat`) | SDK auto-detected both PAT and OAuth | Use the client's explicit OAuth M2M init (current code pins `auth_type="oauth-m2m"`) |
| **`WorkspaceClient has no attribute postgres/database`** | Old `databricks-sdk` | Pin `databricks-sdk>=0.89.0` in `requirements.txt`; redeploy |
| **`generate_database_credential` errors** | Wrong endpoint shape / SDK surface | Ensure `LAKEBASE_RESOURCE` is the endpoint path; current code passes it as `endpoint=...` and falls back to manual on failure |
| **`permission denied` on Lakebase tables** | Service principal lacks grants | Run §9 GRANTs for the role |
| **`role "..." does not exist`** | Wrong role name in GRANT | Re-run the `pg_roles` lookup (§9) and use the exact `rolname` |
| **`relation "..." does not exist`** | Tables not created in this Lakebase DB/branch | Re-run §7 table creation on the `production` branch / `databricks_postgres` |
| **Feedback not saving** | No `intake_id` (intake write failed) or grants missing | Check intake write succeeded; verify grants; the UI shows "Feedback could not be saved right now" on failure |
| **Deploy used an old commit** | App pointed at stale commit/branch | Push to `main`, redeploy, confirm the commit hash in the deploy view |
| **Source path wrong** | App configured with a subfolder path | Leave source path blank (app.py is at repo root) |
| **App starts but blank screen** | Streamlit start command/port issue | Confirm `command: streamlit run app.py`; check app logs for tracebacks |
| **Works locally but not in Databricks App** | Local uses `.env`/manual mode; deployed uses resources/secrets | Verify each `app.yaml` env entry resolves; check resource attachment + grants |

## 15. Closing — How to Present It

Frame the submission as four crisp pillars:

1. **Agentic AI** — a Claude agent that understands free text, asks adaptive
   follow-ups, and writes a personalized plan (not a scripted chatbot).
2. **Governed trusted data** — eligibility grounded in source-labeled NJ programs
   in **Unity Catalog / Delta**, read through a **SQL Warehouse**, with an
   **explainable rules engine** giving a reason for every match.
3. **Lakebase application state** — every journey (intake, matches, plan,
   feedback) persisted transactionally, authenticated via the App's **service
   principal** with rotating credentials.
4. **Social impact analytics** — individual journeys roll up into county needs,
   program demand, and feedback trends.

Be honest about scope (8 curated programs, synthetic inputs) and emphasize that
the architecture makes scaling **additive**, not a rewrite. Keep the demo tight
(scenario A), show the trusted-data caption, the explainable matches, the plan,
the feedback save, and one analytics query.

> **Reminder:** Follow **§0 Official Rules Alignment** throughout — new repo built
> during the Project Period, public open-source repo, Databricks App on Lakebase
> (+ ≥1 additional Databricks tool), permitted tools only, synthetic data only,
> transparent in-window commits, **≤ 3-minute** public video, and disclose AI
> assistance honestly. When unsure, **ask the organizers.**
