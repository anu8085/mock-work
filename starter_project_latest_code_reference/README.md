## 🎯 What It Does

1. **User describes their family situation** in plain language (free-text)
2. **AI extracts key profile attributes** (household size, income, children's ages, work status, etc.)
3. **Targeted clarifying questions** are generated to fill in gaps
4. **Rules-based eligibility screening** filters programs across 5 categories
5. **Personalized action plan** is generated - warm, specific, and actionable

Databricks AI Summit Hackathon - *Benefits Navigator for Families*  
New Jersey MVP · Powered by Claude (Anthropic) + Streamlit


## V12 Lakebase Auth Note

For the mock hackathon and live demo, use native Lakebase/Postgres password auth stored as Databricks secrets. The deployed app should use injected PG* connection variables where available and secret-backed PGUSER/PGPASSWORD or LAKEBASE_USER/LAKEBASE_PASSWORD. OAuth generate-database-credential is documented as a future production enhancement only. See `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` in the kit.
