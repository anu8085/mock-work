"""
databricks_client.py

Reads TRUSTED, source-labeled benefits program data from Unity Catalog.

The table `benefits_navigator.trusted.benefit_programs` is a curated
("trusted") layer in Unity Catalog. Every row is expected to carry
provenance / source-labeling columns (source_name, source_url, source_type,
last_verified_date) so the app can show users where each benefit program
fact came from and when it was last verified.

This module only READS data. It connects to a Databricks SQL Warehouse using
the official `databricks-sql-connector` and credentials supplied through
environment variables (never hard-coded, never printed):

    DATABRICKS_SERVER_HOSTNAME  - e.g. "<workspace-host-without-https>"
    DATABRICKS_HTTP_PATH        - e.g. "/sql/1.0/warehouses/<warehouse-id>"
    DATABRICKS_TOKEN            - a Databricks personal access token

Secrets are read from the environment and are NEVER logged or printed.
